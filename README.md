I've been fashinated by Tne Night Cage tabletob game https://www.thenightcage.com/ since I received some advertisements
a week or so before Halloween. I even tried to purchase it, but it's currently unavailable in Europe (the only
shop I found ships in USA only).

The authors provide the whole rulebook online, though, so it's possible to play it.

During the covid-19 pandemic I built a web app to play another tabletop game online with relatives I couldn't meet at the
time. Therefore I decided to start this project following the same pattern.

This is the b/e for a web version of the TNG game.
